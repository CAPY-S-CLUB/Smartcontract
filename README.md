npm or yarn

MetaMask or another Web3 wallet

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd smartcontract--hackmeridian

Install dependencies:
npm install

Set up environment variables:
cp .env.example .env

Edit the .env file with your settings

Configuration
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root with the following variables:

PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key

Usage
Compilation
npm run compile

Testing
npm run test

Deployment

Local Network (Hardhat): npm run deploy:local

Testnet (Sepolia): npm run deploy:sepolia

Mainnet: npm run deploy:mainnet

Smart Contracts
Main Contracts

ContractName.sol: Description of the main contract

Token.sol: ERC-20/ERC-721 token implementation

Governance.sol: Decentralized governance system

Features

Creation of a Custom Non-Fungible Token (NFT)

Owner-Based Access Control (Ownable)

Sequential NFT Minting

Testing
The project includes comprehensive tests for all contracts:

Run all tests: npm run test

Run tests with coverage: npm run test:coverage

Run specific tests: npm run test -- --grep "ContractName"

Deployment and Verification
Automated Deployment
The project uses automated scripts for deployment:

Deploy to a specific network: npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia

Contract Verification

Verify contract on Etherscan:
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Constructor arg 1" "Constructor arg 2"

Security
Best Practices

Use of OpenZeppelin for standard contracts

Implementation of pausable mechanisms in critical contracts

Rigorous input validation

Protection against reentrancy attacks
